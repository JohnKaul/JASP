ACME AMERICAN WROUGHT ANVILS - THEY RING LIKE A BELL.
No anvil made, English or American, surpasses our Acme in shape, material
or finish. It is solid forged of two pieces of best wrought iron, welded at
waist; face is made of one piece of tool steal, electrically welded to the
body and warranted not to come loose. Base has sufficient spread to
insure stability and prevent tipping.
