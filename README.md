JASP (Just Another Simple Preprocessor)
====

This is a "preprocessor" project. This tool started off intending to
extend the AutoLisp application development process (A language for
the AutoCAD program) in both a group and solo development environment
but I wanted to convert this simple application to use the LLVM
libraries as a learning exercise.

The command line flags are:
  -d=<string,string> - Specify a definition
  -i=<path>          - Specify include file location
  -license           - Print the license
  -o=<filename>      - Specify output filename
  -print             - Print informational messages

...

See the README.txt in the DOC directory.
